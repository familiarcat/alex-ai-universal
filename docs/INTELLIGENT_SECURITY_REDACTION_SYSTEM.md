# 🧠 Alex AI Intelligent Security Redaction System

## 🎯 **ENHANCED SECURITY APPROACH**

**Alex AI now uses intelligent redaction to maintain client confidentiality while enabling learning and knowledge sharing.** The system blocks secrets completely but redacts sensitive client information while preserving valuable learning data.

## 🛡️ **Security Categories & Actions**

### **🚫 ALWAYS BLOCKED (Never Stored)**
- **API Keys & Tokens**: `API_KEY=sk_test_1234567890abcdef`
- **Database Credentials**: `postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/db`
- **Cloud Service Keys**: `aws_access_key`, `stripe_key`, etc.
- **Environment Variables**: `process.env.DATABASE_URL`

### **🔍 INTELLIGENTLY REDACTED (Learning Enabled)**
- **Client Data**: Redact names, contact info → Keep client type
- **Financial Information**: Redact client details → Keep metrics by client type
- **Business Strategy**: Redact client info → Keep strategy elements by client type

## 🧠 **Learning Data Extraction**

### **Client Type Classification**
```javascript
// Extracted from: "Client: Acme Marketing Firm Inc."
Client Type: marketing_firm

// Extracted from: "Tech startup with B2B SaaS model"
Client Type: startup
Business Type: b2b_saas
```

### **Financial Metrics (Anonymized)**
```javascript
// Original: "Client: Acme Inc. Revenue: $500,000, Profit: $100,000"
// Redacted: "Client A (marketing_firm): revenue: 500,000, profit: 100,000"
Financial Metrics (Client A): revenue: 500,000, profit: 100,000, budget: 50,000
```

### **Strategy Elements (Anonymized)**
```javascript
// Original: "Client: XYZ LLC business plan includes growth strategy"
// Redacted: "Client A (consulting_firm): strategy, growth, market, expansion"
Strategy Elements: strategy, growth, market, expansion
```

## 🔄 **Redaction Process**

### **Step 1: Content Analysis**
```
Input: "Client: Digital Marketing Agency Inc. (contact@agency.com) - B2B SaaS company with revenue: $2M, profit: $400K, budget: $200K. Strategy includes market expansion and competitive positioning."
```

### **Step 2: Learning Data Extraction**
```javascript
{
  clientType: "marketing_agency",
  businessType: "b2b_saas", 
  financialMetrics: {
    revenue: "2M",
    profit: "400K", 
    budget: "200K"
  },
  strategyElements: ["strategy", "market", "expansion", "competitive", "positioning"]
}
```

### **Step 3: Intelligent Redaction**
```
Output: "Client Type: marketing_agency
Business Type: b2b_saas

Financial Metrics (Client A): revenue: 2M, profit: 400K, budget: 200K

Strategy Elements: strategy, market, expansion, competitive, positioning

Client A. ([REDACTED]) - B2B SaaS company with revenue: $2M, profit: $400K, budget: $200K. Strategy includes market expansion and competitive positioning."
