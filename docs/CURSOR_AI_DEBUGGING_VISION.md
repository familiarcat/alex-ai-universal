# üéØ Cursor AI Debugging Vision

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Sophisticated AI debugging system with N8N workflow as central nervous system

---

## üéØ **The Vision**

**A Cursor AI user builds a prompt: "can we look at this image (of the UI with a button) to see why this function (an on click function) is not being executed?"**

This triggers:
1. **Complete N8N workflow execution** with all crew members
2. **Dynamic LLM optimization** via OpenRouter based on crew knowledge and persona
3. **Crew member responses** analyzed and compared
4. **Observation Lounge** context for hallucination detection
5. **RAG memory storage** (individual vs shared based on consensus)
6. **Real-time N8N ‚Üî Codebase synchronization**

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Core Components:**

1. **Image Analysis Engine** - Analyzes UI screenshots for debugging
2. **Code Analysis Engine** - Examines function execution issues
3. **Crew Orchestration** - Coordinates all 9 crew members
4. **Dynamic LLM Selection** - OpenRouter optimization per crew member
5. **Observation Lounge** - Hallucination detection and consensus building
6. **RAG Memory System** - Individual and shared memory storage
7. **N8N Workflow Engine** - Central nervous system coordination
8. **Real-time Sync** - N8N ‚Üî Codebase bidirectional updates
