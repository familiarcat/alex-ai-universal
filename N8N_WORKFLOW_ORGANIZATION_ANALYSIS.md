## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Review the proposed schema** and make any adjustments
2. **Run the batch rename script** to implement the organization
3. **Verify the new organization** with the list command
4. **Create folder structure documentation** for the N8N interface
5. **Update crew member workflows** with OpenRouter optimization

**This organization system will provide clear categorization, easy navigation, and scalable structure for the Alex AI N8N workflow ecosystem!** 🖖
