# 🎮 Interactive Real-Time Sync Demo Guide

## 🌐 **Both Dashboards Now Open in Browser**

**Local Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001  
**Deployed Dashboard**: https://n8n.pbradygeorgen.com/dashboard  

---

## 🎯 **Step-by-Step Interactive Demo**

### **Step 1: Locate Sync Toggle Components**
On both dashboards:
1. **Navigate to the right sidebar**
2. **Find the "Real-Time Sync Toggle" component**
3. **Look for the "Sync Proof Mechanism" component below it**

### **Step 2: Start Sync on Local Dashboard**
1. **Click "🔄 Start Sync"** on the local dashboard
2. **Observe the status change** from "disconnected" to "connecting" to "connected"
3. **Watch the sync count increase** as real-time updates occur
4. **Note the environment indicator** showing "local"

### **Step 3: Start Sync on Deployed Dashboard**
1. **Click "🔄 Start Sync"** on the deployed dashboard
2. **Observe the status change** from "disconnected" to "connecting" to "connected"
3. **Watch the sync count increase** as real-time updates occur
4. **Note the environment indicator** showing "deployed"

### **Step 4: Observe Cross-Environment Communication**
1. **Watch both dashboards simultaneously**
2. **Notice real-time status updates** every 2 seconds
3. **Observe sync count increases** on both environments
4. **See the "Last Sync" timestamp** updating in real-time

### **Step 5: Use Sync Proof Mechanism**
1. **Click "▶️ Start"** on the recording controls
2. **Click "🔬 Generate Proof"** on both dashboards
3. **Observe cross-environment events** in the proof history
4. **Watch the statistics update** (Local Syncs, Deployed Syncs, Cross-Environment)
