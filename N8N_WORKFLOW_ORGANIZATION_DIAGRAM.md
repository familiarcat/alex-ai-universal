---

## 🚀 **Ready for Implementation**

The organization system is ready to be implemented using the batch rename script:

```bash
# Run the complete organization
./scripts/organize-n8n-workflows.sh

# Or run individual phases
node scripts/rename-n8n-workflows.js pattern "Crew - Captain Jean-Luc Picard" "CREW - Captain Jean-Luc Picard - Strategic Leadership - OpenRouter - Production"
```

**This organization will transform the N8N interface from a chaotic list into a professional, organized workflow ecosystem!** 🖖
