## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Suspects:**

#### 1. **Credential Configuration Issues** 🔑
- **OpenRouter API Credentials**: May not be properly configured in N8N
- **Supabase Credentials**: Memory storage connections may be failing
- **Authentication Failures**: Causing workflows to stop at credential-dependent nodes

#### 2. **Timeout Issues** ⏱️
- **Node Timeouts**: Individual nodes timing out before completion
- **Workflow Timeouts**: Entire workflows timing out due to resource constraints
- **API Response Delays**: External API calls taking too long

#### 3. **Connection Issues** 🔗
- **Missing Node Connections**: Workflows stopping due to broken connections
- **Data Flow Problems**: Nodes not receiving expected input data
- **Response Node Issues**: Final response nodes not receiving data

#### 4. **Resource Constraints** 💾
- **N8N Instance Resources**: CPU, memory, or disk space limitations
- **Concurrent Execution Limits**: Too many workflows running simultaneously
- **Database Connection Limits**: Supabase or N8N database connection issues

## 🎯 **Recommended Diagnostic Actions**

### **Phase 1: Credential Verification**
1. **Check OpenRouter API Key**: Verify it's properly configured in N8N credentials
2. **Test OpenRouter API**: Make direct API calls to verify connectivity
3. **Verify Supabase Credentials**: Check memory storage connection
4. **Test Individual APIs**: Verify each external service connection

### **Phase 2: Workflow Analysis**
1. **Use Quark as Test Case**: Leverage the 83% success rate workflow
2. **Monitor Execution Flow**: Track where Quark workflow stops (when it does)
3. **Compare with Failed Workflows**: Identify differences between successful and failed executions
4. **Test Individual Nodes**: Verify each node type works independently

### **Phase 3: Resource Analysis**
1. **Check N8N Instance Resources**: CPU, memory, disk usage
2. **Review N8N Logs**: Look for error messages or warnings
3. **Monitor Database Performance**: Check Supabase and N8N database health
4. **Analyze Concurrent Execution**: Check for resource contention

## 🚀 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Use Quark for System Diagnosis**
```bash
# Test Quark workflow with diagnostic prompt
curl -X POST https://n8n.pbradygeorgen.com/webhook/crew-quark-optimized \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Quark, diagnose our N8N system failure. 90% of workflows are stopping. What business impact does this have and how do we fix it?", "diagnostic": true}'
```

### **Step 2: Check N8N Interface**
1. Open `https://n8n.pbradygeorgen.com`
2. Navigate to Quark workflow (ID: L6K4bzSKlGC36ABL)
3. Check execution history for error details
4. Verify all node connections are properly drawn
5. Test individual nodes for execution

### **Step 3: Credential Verification**
1. Check N8N credentials configuration
2. Verify OpenRouter API key is valid and active
3. Test Supabase connection for memory storage
4. Verify all external service connections

### **Step 4: Resource Monitoring**
1. Check N8N instance resource usage
2. Monitor database performance
3. Review N8N logs for errors
4. Check for concurrent execution limits
